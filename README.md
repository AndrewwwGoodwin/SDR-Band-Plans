# Introduction
Does the default band plan for your SDR software not have enough detail for you? 
If the answer is yes, we felt the same way on [r/rtlsdr](https://reddit.com/r/rtlsdr) and [r/amateursatellites](https://reddit.com/r/amateursatellites). That's why I decided to create this repository, so the SDR community can construct idealized band plans. 

In this README file we will cover almost  everything you'll want to know. What's in the band plans, how to read them, which software you can use with them, and how to install them. 

<!-- Have you ever wondered what lays within the ocean of photons whose waves we all swim? -->

## Band Plan Instructions
> Example CB allocations reference image.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rBUCJ0D.jpg" width="500"/>

### Notation System
1. The vertical bar (' **|** ') denotes an edge of a larger allocation is on the edge of that banner. Upper or lower allocation edge is dependent on which side of the allocation's name the vertical bar (' **|** ') is on. _e.g. **See CB reference image**: CB| Ch.1 is lowest frequency edge and 40 (SSB)| CB is the highest frequency edge._ 
This method is also used to show nested allocations. _e.g. At 137.1MHz shared center allocations - NOAA-19 (40kHz wide), inside METEOR (120kHz wide), inside SpaceBees (150kHz wide) allocations._

1. Channelized allocations may omitt the 'Ch.' (Channel) descripter within its allocation area when either the general allocation is large and can be colored distinctly from neighboring allocations or individual channels are narrow or harder to read. _e.g. **See CB reference image**: CB channels not showing 'Ch.' in any channel but 1._

1. Parentheses (' **( )** ') is used when clarification may be of help. e.g. _Television Ch.2 (VHF)_, _OrbComm Ch.1 (Downlink)_, _Public Safety (EMS/ Fire/ Police)_

### Allocation Sources
In the SDR# (XML) band plan file, usually every 25 lines allocations have sources comments listed below them. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gAqdyXx.png" width="3000"/>

> Image of allocations with sources comments below them (in the XML file).

##
SDR++ however, uses JSON which does not natively support commenting, therefore no self-documenting capability for citing sources. 
As a workaround, the SDR# XML file here on github at **_US/SDR#/BandPlan.xml_** or your local copy of the XML file open in a code editor could be used as a reference. Alternatively, you can reference the sources folder. However, it is limited in sources to avoid any potential copyright issues.

Gqrx does not list source comments yet, so for now, follow the same workaround as SDR++. This should not be a problem as all band plans should have the same allocations.  

### Color Legend
1. All allocation colors follow a color legend. You can refer to this color legend in the [Color Legend Listed](#color-legend-listed) section of this README or use the SDR# XML file. 
1. Channelized areas will have alternating individual channel colors similar in appearance but emphasize the different channels within the same general allocation. _e.g. **See CB reference image**: shows odd channels are lighter and even channels are darker._



### What to Keep in Mind
  
When using these band plans, keep in mind:

- These band plans are a guide and many allocations cannot be guaranteed accurate everywhere. 
- Watch for interference, imaging, harmonics, and be aware of the limitations of your SDR. Signals can appear to be at frequencies they are not for various technical reasons.
- Secondary allocations and locally different allocations can be hard to confirm and may not always be publicly listed on online databases.

## Create Your Own Band Plan

An SDR# XML band plan template is provided for experimentation and customization.  
It gives users anywhere the ability to assign a band plan to their regional or personal needs, which can then be shared with the greater SDR community if desired.  
It has a simple layout with nothing more than a basic structure that the writer can adhere to if they desire. Luckily XML is a simple language that can be easily learned by those even with little skill in programming.

# Installation

### SDR#â€‹

1. Open the SDR# 'bin' folder. e.g. _C:\SDRSharp\bin_
1. **_Make sure to make a copy of the old default band plan in case something doesn't work!_**
1. Download the repository ([**Click Here** to download the ZIP file](https://github.com/Arrin-KN1E/SDR-Band-Plans/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) and extract the folder. 
1. Navigate to the file you want (e.g. *SDR-Band-Plans-master/US/SDR#*), select the file named `BandPlan` then copy & paste or drag & drop the file into the SDR 'bin' folder. (Ensure that SDR# is not running, otherwise the BandPlan.xml file will be overwritten with original data when exiting.)
1. If prompted to replace the old `BandPlan` file, say yes. _(Assuming you did make a copy of the old band plan file, you're prepared to undo this change if necessary.)_  

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RrgZ5Ki.png" width="3000"/>  

> **You can just drop it in the SDR# folder.** 
***

### SDR++
>***Currently in testing, this process may change in the future!***

**SDR++ takes a little more work, but still is easy enough:**

1. Locate the band plans folder in SDR++. example for windows: _sdrpp_windows_x64/res/bandplans_
2. Download the repository ([**Click Here** to download the ZIP file](https://github.com/Arrin-KN1E/SDR-Band-Plans/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) and extract the folder.
3. Navigate to the file you want (e.g. *SDR-Band-Plans-master/US/SDR++*), then drag and drop the `usa-kn1e` JSON file into the SDR++ bandplans folder. _(So far, this would show the allocations if selected in SDR++, but there would be no color to the band plan banners.)_
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZwvncI3.jpg" width="3000"/>

4. Locate the `config` file in the main SDR++ folder. Example for windows: The _sdrpp_windows_x64>_  folder, you should see 'modules', 'recordings', & 'res' folders if in the right location.  _(If your SDR++ has not been ran before, run the program now so it can generate a config file.)_ 
**_Make sure to make a copy of the old default config file in case something doesn't work!_**
5. In the extracted Github repository folder, open the `Config BandColors Modification.txt` in a text/ code editor and copy all of the text in the file.
6. Open the SDR++ `config` file in a text/ code editor and paste the previously copied code between the `"bandColors": {` line and the `"amateur": "#FF0000FF",` line in that field. _(Make sure to keep the old code, maintain the code formatting, and check for missing or extra commas; only the last line in that field `"military": "#FFFF00FF"` should not have a comma after it.)_

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iWjZ6qo.jpg" width="3000"/> 

> _'config' file contents before and after modification._  

7. Save any open files and open SDR++, if it looks like the sample images in this README then it's good to go!  


The strange hex format basically brute-force converts the color format used in SDR# to the color format used in SDR++. It was easier to adapt the XML file to JSON this way, but this will most likely be updated in the future.

### Gqrx

1. Locate the folder where Gqrx _bandplan.csv_ is located. Example for Raspberry Pi OS: _home/user/.config/gqrx_
2. Download the repository ([**Click Here** to download the ZIP file](https://github.com/Arrin-KN1E/SDR-Band-Plans/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) and extract the folder.
3. Navigate to the file you want (e.g. *SDR-Band-Plans-master/US/Gqrx*), then drag and drop the `bandplan.csv` file into the Gqrx folder. _(Make sure to make a backup of the original bandplan.csv. Also, if you see no files in the folder, run Gqrx at least once)_.
